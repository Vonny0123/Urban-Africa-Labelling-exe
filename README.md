# Urban-Africa-Labelling-exe

This repository contains the constituent files required to create a Windows executable (.exe) file with PyInstaller. The application guides the user to load relevant data and give inputs to implement the Urban Africa Labelling tool to label long/lat pairs in Africa as urban or rural using the Africapolis dataset. This project was completed to allow those with no Python knowledge access to the tool, overcoming the speed constraints of the web application by running on the local machine (with no Python installation necessary). The application can be downloaded from my Google Drive (the folder is too big for GitHub) https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IZUmXa5qvQv8VIMBK-ckYuakvjbDsmHS?usp=sharing. Simply download and unzip the folder, and locate the app 'Urban Africa Labelling.exe' and run it
